        <p><q>Wow this is great!</q>, he said</p>

        <p>Any code of your own that you haven’t looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else. (Eagleson’s Law) There are only two industries that refer to their customers as ‘users’. (Edward Tufte) Computers are useless. They can only give you answers. (Pablo Picasso) No matter how slick the demo is in rehearsal, when you do it in front of a live audience, the probability of a flawless presentation is inversely proportional to the number of people watching, raised to the power of the amount of money involved. (Mark Gibbs)</p>
        <p>There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works. (Alan J. Perlis)</p>
